I want to build an nextjs app that allows me to inspect the Claude Code projects chat history in my laptop.

specs:

- beautiful and professional UI
- list of chat projects with search and filter functionality
- view of individual chat history with timestamps, showing only the first messages
- ability to deep dive into full chat history on demand
- easy way to then call "claude --resume {sessionID}"
- responsive design for different screen sizes
- no autnhentication needed, local access only
